# Computer Vision Nanodegree
Computer Vision exercises completed by Mikaela Sanchez.<br>
Most of these exercises are a part of the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891"><b>Computer Vision Nanodegree</b></a> provided by <b>Udacity</b>, in collaboration with <b>Affectiva</b> and <b>NVIDIA</b>.

## Breakdown of Nanodegree
<i>These descriptions are provided on the Computer Vision Nanodegree page, linked above.</i>
### Introduction to Computer Vision
Master computer vision and image processing essentials. Learn to extract important features from image data, and apply deep learning techniques to classification tasks.<br>
<i><b>Project: </b>Facial Keypoint Detection</i>
### Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning
Learn to apply deep learning architectures to computer vision tasks. Discover how to combine CNN and RNN networks to build an automatic image captioning application.<br>
<i><b>Project: </b>Automatic Image Captioning</i>
### Object Tracking and Localization
Learn how to locate an object and track it over time. These techniques are used in a variety of moving systems, such as self-driving car navigation and drone flight.<br>
